Acknowledgmenet: this is basically a copy of https://github.com/vim-scripts/functionlist.vim

I made a few tiny changes to work with Python etc.

* Looks for lines that have "def " in them (rather than "function")
* Leaves functions sorted in order they appear in the file (to turn sorting 
  back on, uncomment the line in 'function! s:index()' ).

Suggested: map to leader+z like so in your .vimrc:

  :nnoremap <Leader>z :Flisttoggle<CR>
