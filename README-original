This plugin displays a list of all lines with word 'function' in current file/buffer. This list is sorted on function name.

It also maintains a list of recently accessed functions at the top so that you can switch between functions easily, This list is updated when the user navigates to the function list window. The required function can be quickly reached in the list by pressing the first letter of the function. Pressing 'p' cycles through all the functions starting with 'p'.

This Plugin is best suited for working with  long source code files with functions defined with 'function' keyword.

command to open function list

:Flisttoggle 


To make this plugin really useful you have to assign a shortcut key for this, 
say you want F2 key to open the function list.

you can add the following line in your .vimrc file. 

            map <F2> : Flisttoggle <CR>

If you are on windows " the file name would be _vimrc. The .vimrc file is  
usually present in the users home directory.

vimrc file will be hidden in linux so you will have to do a ls -ah to see it. 

If the file  is not present you can just add one file with this line only.

you have to Restart vim 

Invoking this plugin opens a new vertical  window right to current window
